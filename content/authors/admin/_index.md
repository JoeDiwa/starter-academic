<p style="text-align:justify">I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Macroeconomics at CREEi, ESG-UQAM, Canada. I hold a PhD in Economics from Free University of Bozen-Bolzano (FUB), Italy. My research interests span the areas of macroeconomics, labour market dynamics, immigration, population ageing and business cycle. Methodologically, my research agenda greatly focuses on the application of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) modeling.
