We propose a large structural VAR model with an identification scheme based on sign restriction to identify several structural shocks. We disentangle supply and demand shocks from labor market shocks and quantify their importance for economic fluctuations. We take advantage of data on the labor force participation rate to impose additional restrictions, gauge its responsiveness to shocks and identify an additional shock (the price mark-up shock) that enhances participation in the labor market. For our experiment, we use quarterly Italian data spanning the period 2000Q1-2018Q4 in an attempt to shed light on the ongoing debate among researchers and policymakers about the development of the Italian labor market. Our results show that labor market shocks are among the largest drivers of macroeconomic fluctuations. We find that the wage bargaining shock plays a central role in driving up macroeconomic volatility in the short-run while the relevance of labor supply shocks is pronounced in the middle-run and long-run. The role of the mismatch shock in explaining macroeconomic dynamics is sizable but limited for the business cycle. The dominance of labor market shocks is amplified across horizons and various alternative specifications.
